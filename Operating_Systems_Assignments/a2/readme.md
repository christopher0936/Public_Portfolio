Task 1 of the assignment works more or less perfectly. My implementation was partly based upon the pseudocode in the textbook that addresses the readers/writers problem, and my code passes scenario 1 (modified to have delay between the curl commands as was suggested in rocket chat) without issue.

For Task 2, the code I have written can and does pass scenario 2, but requires some delay in excess of what I would consider "normal". I believe this to be the result of the process scheduler, and it is likely not something that I could address on my own within the confines of the assignment. When tested without the delay, the program does function, but the order in which curl requests are processed by the server becomes unpredictable, leading to results that appear random. This is, however, solved by adding delay between the curl requests, and when this is done the program functions perfectly.
