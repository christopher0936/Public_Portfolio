# Chris McLaughlin's Public Portfolio

Hi there! My name is Chris McLaughlin and this is my public portfolio, with everything I feel like sharing publicly for any who are interested! In it you'll mostly find past personal projects and coursework. While most code should be runnable "out-of-the-box", this may not hold true for code which has been sanitized for privacy or copyright reasons. I plan to add to this repo continually over time, however there should be enough to get a general feel for my coding style or get some inspiration for your own projects!

My main language of choice is Python, but I also have plenty of C experience, as well as exposure to Java, Javascript, and OCaml. I work fluently in either Windows or Linux dev environments and have a talent for automation with scripting.

## Overview
### Commu-MNIST Revolution
My portion of a group final project for a Data Mining course. Involved generating a MNIST-like Cyrillic dataset and implementing and comparing the results of SVMs using different hyperparameters to classify the data.

### Operating Systems Assignments
A collection of assignments from a class on Operating Systems, where assignments revolved around creating simulations of various operating system component systems in C.

### Data Mining Assignments
Assignments from a course on Data Mining revolving around Machine Learning algorithms. Solutions are implemented in Python via Jupyter Notebooks.
