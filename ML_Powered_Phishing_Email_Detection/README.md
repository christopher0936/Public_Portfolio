# ML-Powered Phishing Email Detection
This project was undertaken as a group of six as the Capstone Project of the Master of Telecommunications and Information Security program at the University of Victoria. Focused on identifying phishing emails utilising machine learning methods including Naive Bayes classifers, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, and Logistic Regression. Achieved an F1 performance of 0.9967 utilising an RBF kernel SVM with TF-IDF feature extraction. Model exceeded performance of legacy email filtering solutions and with adequate software support is suitable for deployment as an organisational email filter. See presentation or written report for complete results.
