<br><br>
Round up your chat while you're still starting stream, keep them entertained while you BRB, or even stage epic battles with your chat as a stream activity!
ChatBattlers supports a fully transparent overlay mode, putting you in control of the experience, so you can choose how your stream looks while you play the game with your chat!
Hold your own little contests and Battle Royals within the game!
You can even give your chat members special skins that you've collected, for chatters who haven't downloaded the game to customize their characters themselves!
