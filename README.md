# Chris McLaughlin's Public Portfolio

I'm Chris McLaughlin and this is my public portfolio, with everything I feel I can share publicly for any who are interested! In it you'll find past personal projects, the professional work I'm able to share, and coursework. While most code should be runnable "out-of-the-box", this may not be the case for code which has been sanitized for privacy or copyright reasons. I plan to add to this continually over time, however there should be enough here to get a general feel for my coding style or get some inspiration for your own projects!

My languages of choice are Python and Javascript (including Vue), but I also have experience with C, as well as exposure to Java and OCaml. I work in both Windows and Linux development environments and have a talent for automation with scripting.

## My Work
### [ChattBattlers Website](https://github.com/christopher0936/Public_Portfolio/tree/main/chatbattlers-site)
Freelance Web Development Project. Shared with permission. Built a Nuxt3 Content site utilising Vue, JS, and TailwindCSS for a client releasing a Twitch-integrated chat-interaction game ([which you should check out!](https://chatbattlers.com/))

### [Programming Languages Coursework](https://github.com/christopher0936/Public_Portfolio/tree/main/Programming_Languages_Cousework)
Coursework from a crash-course style class on Programming Languages, where we ran through several different languages including OCaml, Racket, Ruby, and APL, with an aim of gaining exposure to an array of different language types, with a focus on functional vs object-oriented programming, static vs dynamic typing, and interpreted vs compiled languages, both in theory and in practice, through hands on exercises and assignments.

### [Commu-MNIST Revolution](https://github.com/christopher0936/Public_Portfolio/tree/main/Commu-MNIST-Revolution)
My portion of a group final project for a Data Mining course. Involved generating a MNIST-like Cyrillic dataset and implementing and comparing the results of SVMs using different hyperparameters to classify the data.

### [Data Mining Assignments](https://github.com/christopher0936/Public_Portfolio/tree/main/Data_Mining_Assignments)
Earlier assignments from the same course on Data Mining, assignments revolve around Machine Learning algorithms. Solutions are implemented in Python via Jupyter Notebooks.

### [Operating Systems Assignments](https://github.com/christopher0936/Public_Portfolio/tree/main/Operating_Systems_Assignments)
A collection of assignments from a class on Operating Systems, where assignments revolved around creating simulations of various operating system component systems in C.
